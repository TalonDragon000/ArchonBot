"Welcome to Esridar, the land of Archons. As an Archon, you possess incredible powers and life longevity beyond that of other creatures. You descend from a mystical and elite force originally formed from aether, the life force, to be guardians and stewards of the world and all that inhabit it.

Each Archon is unique and born with two spheres of power. The first sphere represents your element that grounds and connects you to this physical realm."

`**//------ E L E M E N T S -----//**`

:cloud_tornado: Air
"You control elements of air. Air can range from weather to our very breath."

:ocean: Water 
"You control elements of water. Water can range from mist to frost."

:fire: Fire
"You control elements of Fire. Fire can range from heat to lava flows."

:leaves: Earth
"You control elements of Earth. Earth can range from dirt to flora."

`**//------ P O W E R S -----//**`

"The second sphere is what makes you unique. No other Archon possesses the same power as you do. 

The four main cosmic spheres are held by the faction Praetors: Life, Death, Chaos, and Order. What are yours? 


`**//------ A L I G N M E N T -----//**`

"As with every sentinal being, you do have a choice in life. You can choose a life of goodness, embracing the elements of light; a life of evil, embracing the elements of darkness; or neutral, mastering the life of balance. 

Every Archon starts neither good, nor evil -- perfect, pure, and balanced. Your choices in life determine your alignment."

Your choices within Esridar will determine your alignment over time.

"Here is your first choice. Below are the factions ruled by the four Praetors, each with its own ideal of the best way to rule Esridar and what it means to reach perfection."

:andie: Andrilim: They prize order above all things, that everyone has a purpose to serve in this world, and all conflict can be resolved through reason and diplomacy. 

:delthy: Deltharim: They pride themselves in their violent struggles and believe in the mantra that the strong survive and the weak die. 

:nevi: Nevithim: They seek peace and solitude, dismissing all kinds of violence to embrace pacifist ideals with hopes their isolation will preserve their lot and way of life. 

:malthy: Malthidrim: They hold tight to the traditions of the Old Ones who believe authority is given to those who were chosen as worthy: the direct descendants from the original bloodline who uphold and honor their family's legacies. 

Which faction speaks to you?"

---------
`A word of caution...`

"Be advised. Once your character is born, there is no going back. The only way to alter your character going forward is through your choices..."

"Interesting choice. Now that you've chosen your faction, you will notice one of the faction channels have opened up to you. Congrats. You are free to roam your home base as you see fit. However, the other factions are hidden from you. I wonder what they are up to...

Anyway, I'm sure you are tired of my rambling and want to be elsewhere. Look through your options below to gain access to different parts of Esridar. This way, you only see what you want to see.

Good luck on your journey, traveler. I'm sure we will be seeing each other again soon."
